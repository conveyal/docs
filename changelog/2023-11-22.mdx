We are pleased to roll out new analysis capabilities and smoother visualizations. This major release includes **v7.0** of the R5 routing engine and...

- Enhances spatial dataset and regional analysis maps. The new maps include smooth scaling, rotation, querying access/density values at specific points, toggling layers on and off, and other features (thanks to vector maps and GPU acceleration).
- Adds time-to-nearest nth facility (["dual" accessibility](https://doi.org/10.1111/gean.12220)) metrics as an experimental feature for CSV results ([#884](https://github.com/conveyal/r5/pull/884)). Using this feature, you can now calculate additional metrics such as those used in the [TransitCenter Equity Dashboard](https://dashboard.transitcenter.org) (the time to nearest hospital and time to third-nearest grocery store). See details [here](guides/compute-freeform#dual-accessibility). We expect to support map results in an upcoming release; let us know what you think in the meantime!
- Provides more regular and detailed updates on regional analysis progress, helping keep cloud workers active when analyses are queued up ([#874](https://github.com/conveyal/r5/pull/874)).
- Shifts travel time sampling points to better correspond with destination densities ([#894](https://github.com/conveyal/r5/pull/894)). This change will alter results relative to past versions of the R5 routing engine. With related user interface changes, older versions of R5 will now result in slightly offset isochrones.
- Ensures that results are readily comparable within the web interface when regional analysis bounds are reused in a subsequent analysis ([#897](https://github.com/conveyal/r5/pull/897), [#898](https://github.com/conveyal/r5/pull/898))
- Improves shapefile upload and validation ([#868](https://github.com/conveyal/r5/pull/868), [#872](https://github.com/conveyal/r5/pull/872)). Geojson uploads are coming soon.
- Improves GTFS upload and validation ([#869](https://github.com/conveyal/r5/pull/869), [#870](https://github.com/conveyal/r5/pull/870), [#873](https://github.com/conveyal/r5/pull/873)).
- Makes default behavior of frequency entries more intuitive.
- Updates R5 to use the latest Java LTS version (21), ensuring security and stability updates over the long term.

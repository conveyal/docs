The latest Conveyal routing engine (**v7.1**) improves the calculation of dual access metrics. These metrics (such as the amount of time needed to reach a threshold of 200 thousand jobs) can now be requested directly in the user interface. This release also makes certain error messages easier to understand, and it makes the latest LODES job and workforce data available for regions in the United States via one-click import.

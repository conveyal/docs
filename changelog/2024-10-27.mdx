The latest Conveyal routing engine is **v7.3**. This version:
- Smooths regional analysis progress, especially when analyses of many different scenarios and on-street mode combinations are queued up
- Enables [advanced network bundle configuration](/prepare-inputs#advanced-bundle-configuration), including options to:
-- Save bike and car-related data tables into built networks, eliminating subsequent re-calculation of these tables
-- Build modifications into baseline network bundles
-- Test experimental routing rules that force pedestrian routing to use sidewalks
- Updates underlying database libraries, facilitating continued security and stability updates over the coming years

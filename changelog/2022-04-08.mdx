We have a few upgrades (including one big one!) and bugfixes to announce this month:
- View your detailed, processed street and transit networks on the map. Finally!
- View data source previews on the map.
- Fix a bug that would auto-zoom reroute modifications on each edit. Now it only auto-zooms when you change routes or patterns.

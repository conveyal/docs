We are pleased to announce the latest Conveyal release. New features in this release let you:
- View your network's street and transit layer details on a new map. Many users have requested this feature, and we are excited to finally release it!

- Preview [Data Sources](/prepare-data) on the map, and upload new data source types
- Use Data Sources in [custom street modifications](/edit-scenario/modifications#custom) for road congestion, slope-adjusted biking times, ridehail service, custom cycling level of traffic stress, and more (experimental)
- Edit reroute modifications more easily, with less distracting auto-zoom behavior

Using a network bundle for the first time with the newly released routing engine (v6.7) may take a few moments, as a fresh network is built. 

Additional improvements include:

- Handling transfers to uncommon route patterns (such as "loop" ‚≠ï and "lollipop" üç≠ routes) more realistically ([details](https://github.com/conveyal/r5/pull/763))
- Fixing a bug that applied walking time limits to non-walk (e.g. bike) requests
- Correcting the order in which stops are added to backwards reroute modifications -- if you created reroute modifications where service extended backward from a stop on an existing pattern between September 2020 and February 2022, your support team can help you correct them
- Reducing computation time when egress modes are changed and transit is toggled on and off

We have a few small changes and bugfixes this month:
- We modified the single point analysis transit mode selector to include groups of similar modes.
- Downloading the JSON representation of the scenario used in a regional analysis is now fixed.
- Running a single point analysis on a deleted project, scenario, or bundle now shows better errors. We also added additional measures to prevent this in the first place.

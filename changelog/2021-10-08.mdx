We're excited to announce these updates in the Conveyal platform and routing engine v6.5. This release makes it easier to:
- Group modifications into different combinations, using a scenario table
<Image alt='Scenario table with different modifications activated' src='/img/scenario-table.png' />
- Create aggregation areas with better progress reporting and validation, using the new [Data Sources](/prepare-data/derivations/#aggregation-areas) panel. In an upcoming release, this panel will also handle spatial datasets for custom origins, destinations, and modifications.
- Save and Undo changes to modifications.
- Avoid certain timing errors on connections experiencing high latency to our central servers.

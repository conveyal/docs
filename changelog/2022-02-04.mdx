We have a few upgrades and bugfixes to announce this month:
- Streamlined transit mode selector and [support for extended GTFS `route_type` values](/prepare-inputs#uploading-gtfs-feeds) (👋 🚝 🚎).
- Re-enabled JSON download of the scenario used in a regional analysis.
- Clearer errors when attempting to analyze a deleted project, scenario, or bundle, and better logical checks to prevent this error in the first place.  
- Cleaner directional markers along modification alignments.

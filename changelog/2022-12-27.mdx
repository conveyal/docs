We're excited to release this highly requested feature! Now, if you select a destination before running a single point analysis you will see a "View route summaries" button to show a summary of routes taken between your origin and destination.  

<Image

  alt='Display a summary of routes to the destination'
/>

The tables on the right include a list of the itineraries used to get from the origin to the destination, including the boarding sttops, route taken, alight stops, and wait time range for each step of the journey. The tables on the left include the itinerary used for each iteration and the total time taken from that iteration.

## Additional improvements and bug fixes
- Improved and increased the errors, warnings, and notices returned while running an analysis.
- Fixed a bug that allowed routing through OSM barrier nodes.
- Fixed a bug that could cause an incorrect bicycle LTS to be set.

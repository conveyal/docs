We're excited to release this highly requested feature! Now, if you select a destination before running a single point analysis you will see a "View routes to destination" button to show a summary of routes taken between your origin and destination.

The tables on the left include the itinerary used for each iteration and the total time taken from that iteration. The tables on the right include a list of the itineraries used to get from the origin to the destination. These itineraries include the access and egress time and modes, total duration range of the trip, how many iterations the itineray was used for, and information about each leg of the journey. Each leg includes the boarding stop, routes taken, alight stop, and duration. Importantly, if a route added by a modification was used it will be shown in this summary.

## Additional improvements and bug fixes
- Improved and increased the errors, warnings, and notices returned while running an analysis.
- Fixed a bug that allowed routing through OSM barrier nodes.
- Fixed a bug that could cause an incorrect bicycle LTS to be set.

We're thrilled to announce a much-requested feature! When you select a destination *before* running a single point analysis, you'll now see a "View routes to destination" button. Click it to view a summary of the routes used to travel between your origin and destination.

The tables on the left show the itinerary used for each iteration and the total time taken from that iteration. The tables on the right list the itineraries used to get from the origin to the destination. These itineraries include the access and egress time and modes, total duration range of the trip, how many iterations the itinerary was used for, and information about each leg of the journey. Each leg includes the boarding stop, routes taken, alight stop, and duration. Notably, any route added by a modification will be shown in this summary.

## Additional improvements and bug fixes
- Improved and increased the errors, warnings, and notices returned while running an analysis.
- Fixed a bug that allowed routing through OSM barrier nodes.
- Fixed a bug that could cause an incorrect bicycle LTS to be set.

By default, a regional analysis in Conveyal calculates accessibility indicators for every point in a [grid](/analysis/methodology#spatial-resolution). 

You can override this default behavior to prepare CSV files with accessibility and travel-time results for a limited number of specified origins at exact coordinates. You first need to upload a CSV file and [process it as a freeform (non-grid) spatial dataset](/prepare-inputs/upload-spatial-data#freeform-non-grid-points). Next, in the custom request settings JSON of the analysis panel, add the fields described below to trigger the preparation of CSV result files. Then, create a [regional analysis](/analysis/regional) with Origin points set to a freeform spatial dataset. Note that the cutoff value will limit results, so set it to 120 if you want full results for trips up to 2 hours. Once a regional analysis with freeform origins is complete, you will have options to download CSV files of the results. These features are still experimental; contact your support team for more information.

## Accessibility
The default `recordAccessibility: true` field in the [custom analysis request JSON](/analysis/configuration#additional-settings) will result in a CSV file with a row for each origin point, destination opportunity layer, travel time percentile, and cutoff.

### Example results

```csv
origin,destinations,percentile,cutoff,access
1,Total Jobs,5,30,386105
1,Total Jobs,5,60,885656
1,Total Jobs,25,30,338122
1,Total Jobs,25,60,867946
1,Total Jobs,50,30,287871
1,Total Jobs,50,60,840089
1,Total Jobs,75,30,234824
1,Total Jobs,75,60,809584
1,Total Jobs,95,30,183107
1,Total Jobs,95,60,773271
2,Total Jobs,5,30	142600
etc
```

## Travel time matrix

Adding `"recordTimes": true` to the [custom analysis request JSON](/analysis/configuration#additional-settings) will result in a CSV file with a row for each origin point, destination point, and travel time percentile. This setting requires freeform spatial datasets to be selected for both the Origin points and the Destination opportunity layer. 

In travel time CSV results, a time of -1 indicates the destination is unreachable within the maximum cutoff specified when the regional analysis was created. The number of destinations is currently limited to 4 million, and the number of origin-destination pairs is limited to 16 million. If you need travel times only for linked pairs of origin-destination coordinates, and a many-to-many analysis would exceed these limits, you can use the `oneToOne` setting described below.

Once you have prepared the desired results, you may want to remove the custom `recordTimes` flag from the custom analysis request JSON to avoid confusion in future analyses.

### Example results

```csv
origin,destination,percentile,time
Cambridge,Cambridge Family Health,5,9
Cambridge,Chelsea High School,5,44
Cambridge,Cambridge Family Health,50,12
Cambridge,Chelsea High School,50,56
Cambridge,Cambridge Family Health,95,12
Cambridge,Chelsea High School,95,-1
South Boston,Cambridge Family Health,5,36
South Boston,Chelsea High School,5,50
South Boston,Cambridge Family Health,50,41
South Boston,Chelsea High School,50,55
South Boston,Cambridge Family Health,95,46
South Boston,Chelsea High School,95,-1
```

### Linked origin-destination pairs (`oneToOne`)

When both origins and destinations are freeform, you can save CSV results for specific matched pairs of origins and destinations, rather than all combinations of origins and destinations. 

To enable this feature, add `"oneToOne": true` to the custom analysis request JSON; then, in the regional analysis creation box, ensure that the origin points and destination layer are from source files with corresponding rows (and therefore have equal numbers of points). This approach can greatly reduce the size of output files, restricting them to only a small set of OD pairs you care about. But it may not reduce compute time (which is primarily affected by the number of origins). If origin coordinates are repeated for different destinations, `"oneToOne": false` will likely be faster even if you do not need all combinations of origins and destinations.

## Path details

Setting `recordPaths:true` will result in a CSV file with the following columns:

* origin: Id of the origin point
* destination: Id of the destination point
* routes: pipe separated list of GTFS routeIds, one per transit leg
* boardStops: pipe separated list of GTFS stopIds, one per transit leg
* alightStops : pipe separated list of GTFS stopIds, one per transit leg
* rideTimes: pipe separated list of in-vehicle travel times (minutes), one per transit leg.
* accessTime: walking time from origin to boarding stop of first transit leg (minutes)
* egressTime: walking time from alighting stop of last transit leg to destination (minutes)
* transferTime: time spent walking between transit stops for transfers (minutes)
* waitTimes: pipe separated list of waiting time (minutes) to board each transit leg, for the specific itinerary following this path that has the lowest waiting time
* totalTime: total time (minutes), for the specific itinerary following this path that has the minimum total time. Because all other components of travel time are fixed for a given path, the itinerary with the lowest waiting time should also be the one with the lowest total time.
* nIterations: number of departure minutes in the departure time window at which this path is optimal. Note the nIterations for each OD pair should sum to the number of total iterations, unless specific departure times result in total travel times that exceed the maximum cutoff.

## API access
To prepare travel time surfaces, isochrones, or accessibility results for specific sets of origins using Python scripts, see the notebook in this [repository](https://github.com/conveyal/batch-isochrones). This notebook is provided as an example only, and Conveyal provides no guarantee of ongoing API compatibility for such external scripts.

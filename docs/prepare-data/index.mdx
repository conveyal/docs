Conveyal provides multiple options for uploading and using your own data. 

The Data Sources panel allows uploading files, validating them, and processing them for use in different parts of Conveyal. For now, the main use of this panel is uploading shapefiles and converting them to [aggregation areas](/prepare-data/derivations/#aggregation-areas).

Custom origins and destination opportunity layers can be managed in the [spatial datasets panel](/prepare-inputs/upload-spatial-data), which supports CSV and shapefile uploads. Custom street and transit network data can be managed in the [network bundle panel](./prepare-inputs#creating-a-network-bundle). These options will eventually be consolidated on the Data Sources panel.

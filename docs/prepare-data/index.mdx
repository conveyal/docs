Conveyal provides multiple options for uploading and using your own data. 

The Data Sources panel allows uploading files, validating them, and processing them for use in different parts of Conveyal:
* Polygonal shapefiles with zone names: covert to [aggregation areas](/prepare-data/derivations/#aggregation-areas)
* Polygonal geojson files with waiting times or speed factors: use in [pickup delay](/edit-scenario/modifications#pickup-delay) or [road congestion](/edit-scenario/modifications#road-congestion) modifications
* Linear shapefiles with bicycle level of traffic stress (LTS) attributes: use with [Custom LTS](/edit-scenario/modifications#custom-lts) modifications
* Raster geotiff files representing elevation or sun exposure layers: use with [Raster cost](/edit-scenario/modifications#raster-cost) modifications

Once a data source has been uploaded, selecting it from the drop-down menu will display a limited preview (up to 1000 features or the bounding box) on the map.

Custom origins and destination opportunity layers can be managed in the [spatial datasets panel](/prepare-inputs/upload-spatial-data), which supports CSV and shapefile uploads. Custom street and transit network data can be managed in the [network bundle panel](./prepare-inputs#creating-a-network-bundle). These options will eventually be consolidated on the Data Sources panel.

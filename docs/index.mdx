This manual will help you use [Conveyal](http://conveyal.com) to edit land-use and transportation scenarios, and evaluate them in terms of accessibility.

Log in at [https://analysis.conveyal.com](https://analysis.conveyal.com) with a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) using the instructions sent via e-mail, then select a region and project to use. 

Once you have selected a project, you can [edit](edit-scenario) and [analyze](analysis) scenarios. Most users will already have a project prepared when they first log in and can skip the Network Setup steps. If you don't see a region or a project, you'll first need to [prepare a baseline network](prepare-inputs) or get in touch with your support team.
